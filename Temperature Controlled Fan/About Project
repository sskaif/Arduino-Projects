🔹 Project Name: Temperature Controlled Fan using Arduino and LM35
🧠 Description:

This project automatically controls the speed of a DC motor (fan) based on temperature using an LM35 sensor and Arduino. As the temperature increases, the Arduino reads higher analog values and adjusts the fan speed using PWM signals. The system is simple, energy-efficient, and demonstrates automation in embedded systems.

⚙️ Components and Their Purpose
Component	Description / Purpose
Arduino UNO	Acts as the main controller that reads sensor data, processes it, and controls the fan speed using PWM signals.
LM35 Temperature Sensor	Provides an analog voltage proportional to the temperature (10 mV per °C), allowing Arduino to measure temperature easily.
DC Motor (Fan)	Represents the cooling fan that changes speed according to temperature.
NPN Transistor (TIP120 / 2N2222)	Works as a switch or driver to control the motor, since Arduino pins cannot supply enough current directly.
Diode (1N4007)	Protects the transistor and Arduino from reverse current (back EMF) generated by the motor when it turns off.
Resistor (220 Ω)	Limits the base current to the transistor to prevent damage.
Connecting Wires & Breadboard	Used to build the circuit and make connections easily for prototyping.
🔍 Working Principle:

The LM35 measures temperature and outputs a proportional voltage.

The Arduino reads this analog voltage through pin A0 and converts it to temperature.

Depending on the temperature value, Arduino sends a PWM signal to the transistor base.

The transistor drives the DC motor (fan) with varying speed — higher PWM duty cycle → faster rotation.

The diode prevents reverse current from damaging the transistor.
