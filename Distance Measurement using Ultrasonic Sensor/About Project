🔹 Project Name: Distance Measurement using Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
🧠 Description:

This project measures the distance between an object and the sensor using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays the measured distance on the Serial Monitor. The Arduino sends a trigger pulse to the sensor, which emits an ultrasonic wave; the time taken for the echo to return is used to calculate the distance. This project demonstrates the concept of ultrasonic sensing, timing, and real-world measurement using Arduino.

⚙️ Components and Their Purpose
Component	Description / Purpose
Arduino UNO	Acts as the main controller. It sends trigger pulses to the sensor, receives the echo signal, calculates time and converts it into distance.
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)	Sends and receives ultrasonic waves to measure the distance to an object using the time-of-flight principle.
Jumper Wires	Used to connect the sensor pins to the Arduino.
Breadboard	Helps organize and hold the circuit connections.
USB Cable	Powers the Arduino and enables serial communication for distance display.
🔍 Working Principle:

The Arduino sends a short HIGH pulse (10 µs) to the Trigger pin of the HC-SR04.

The sensor emits ultrasonic sound waves (at 40 kHz).

When these waves hit an object, they bounce back and are received by the Echo pin.

The Arduino measures the time taken for the echo to return.

Using the formula

Distance (cm)=Time(µs)×0.0343/2

	​


it calculates the distance and displays it on the Serial Monitor.
