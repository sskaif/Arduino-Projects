# 🔌 Arduino Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of **Arduino projects**!  
This repository includes simple to intermediate-level projects written in **Embedded C** using the **Arduino IDE** (and compatible simulators like Wokwi or Tinkercad).

Each project is designed to help understand **microcontroller programming**, **sensor interfacing**, and **embedded system concepts** step by step.

## 🚀 Features
- Beginner to intermediate Arduino projects  
- Well-documented source code with comments  
- Circuit diagrams and simulation links (Wokwi/Tinkercad)  
- Focus on Embedded C programming fundamentals  
- Ideal for students & entry-level embedded engineers

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Basic I/O control (LED, button, buzzer)
- Sensors (LDR, temperature, ultrasonic, etc.)
- Displays (LCD, 7-segment)
- Motors and actuators (servo, DC motor)
- Communication (Serial, I2C, SPI)
- Mini automation and IoT-based examples

---

## 🧩 Tools & Software
- **Arduino IDE** (or VS Code with Arduino extension)
- **Wokwi** / **Tinkercad** (for simulation)
- **Proteus** (optional, for circuit testing)
