🗑️ Smart Dustbin using Arduino
📘 Project Overview

The Smart Dustbin is an IoT-based embedded system project that uses an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to automatically open the dustbin lid when an object (like a hand) is detected nearby.
This helps promote touchless waste disposal, improving hygiene and convenience in daily life.

⚙️ Components Used
Component	Function
Arduino Uno	Acts as the main controller to process sensor data and control the servo motor.
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)	Measures the distance between the dustbin and any approaching object.
Servo Motor (SG90)	Opens and closes the dustbin lid based on sensor readings.
Jumper Wires & Breadboard	Used for electrical connections between components.
Power Supply (5V)	Provides power to the Arduino and connected components.
🧠 Working Principle

The Ultrasonic Sensor continuously measures the distance to detect nearby objects using sound waves.

When the sensor detects an object within 15 cm, it sends this data to the Arduino Uno.

The Arduino processes the data and sends a signal to the Servo Motor.

The Servo Motor rotates by 90°, opening the lid automatically.

After a few seconds (around 3 seconds), the servo returns to its original position, closing the lid.

The Serial Monitor displays the measured distance in real-time for debugging and monitoring.

💡 Key Features

Automatic operation – opens lid when user approaches.

Touchless and hygienic – ideal for public and home use.

Low-cost and easy to build – uses basic Arduino components.

Expandable – can be upgraded with sensors like IR or IoT connectivity (e.g., full-bin alert).

🧩 Applications

Smart waste management systems

Public places (malls, offices, hospitals)

Home automation and hygiene projects

Demonstration of embedded system automation

📊 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of sensors, actuators, and microcontroller programming using Arduino.
It is an excellent beginner-level embedded systems project that shows how sensors and actuators work together to build a real-world automated solution.
